## Stack as a Service STAAS. 

* Life Cycle Management
* Naming ( Open to web in case of Web Controller )
* Each instance Configurable ( size etc ) through JSON
* Stack can act as a Source. Hence listeners can be wired
  1. Planning to make this configurable. Size and other feature....configured via json. Will need to decide on the configuration file format. (.. when time comes )
  2. The listeners can be written in seperate modules and can be wired to source via configuration ( this can be done... phasewise )
  3. Support List of standard events.. will need a separate document for this. Future flexibility for custom events.
* Support for Decorator Pattern
* Support for Proxy Pattern 
* Support for Composite Pattern
